# Aerofox is now discontinued, as I feel I can no longer use 8.1 without issues due to a PC hardware upgrade. If you would like to fork it, you can, as long as you credit me and Travis.

Aerofox is a userchrome.css modification that (almost) pixel-perfectly replicates the look and feel of Internet Explorer version 8 (which shipped with Windows 7) on Firefox 108-109.

Reminder that the code is very, VERY messy. Things **WILL** break with newer Firefox releases.

Based on and inspired by 07Fox, the work of [travis](https://github.com/travy-patty) on the WinClassic forums, go check out his amazing theme over [here](https://winclassic.boards.net/thread/1524/07fox-internet-explorer-mozilla-firefox "here")!

## Supported operating systems
While you may be able to use the theme on macOS, Linux, and BSD, it will not function as intended. This theme was coded ONLY for the built-in Aero style under Windows Vista, 7, and 8.x. Other themes or operating systems may cause the theme not to display as intended.  
**Windows 10 is compatible with DWM hacks and skinning software, but no support will be provided.  
No support is planned for Windows 11, either.**

**Tested on:**  
- Windows Vista SP2 x64 (with Extended Kernel by win32)  
- Windows 7 SP1 x64  
- Windows 8.0 x64  
- Windows 8.0 x64 with Aero Glass DWM hack  
- Windows 8.1 x64 with Aero Glass DWM hack  
- Windows 8.1 x64  
- Windows 10 (Version 20h2) x64 with Stardock WindowBlinds 11
- Windows 11 (Version 22h2) x64 with Stardock WindowBlinds 11

## FAQ
- **Why would anyone want to make/use this? What is wrong with you?**  
I made this for fun, to see how similar I could make Firefox look like an old version of Internet Explorer. 
Additionally, I prefer the aesthetics of Internet Explorer 8 and Windows Aero over current design trends.
- **How do I install it?**  
Read [installation.md](https://github.com/NWinXP/Aerofox/blob/main/installation.md "installation.md") for detailed installation instructions.
- **How did you change the Firefox branding? How can I get navigation sounds and other miscellaneous tweaks?**  
Read [extras.md](https://github.com/NWinXP/Aerofox/blob/main/extras.md "extras.md") for some extra tweaks and cool stuff, and instructions on how to edit the contents of omni.ja's strings.  
- **Can I modify it?**  
You are free to do whatever you want with this theme, it's freely available after all!
